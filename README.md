# Introduction

**SmartProxy** was intended to be designed to help you get better gameplay advantages while using the least amount of resources as possible and being easy to use.

**SmartProxy** is currently aimed at *Minecraft 1.12.2 Crystal PvP*.

# Features

* Supports any account cracked/premium
* Automatically detects server joins and proxies them
* Ping-spoofing
* Built-in utilties/"hacks" ðŸ¤‘ (soon)
* more coming soon...

    *(**IMPORTANT**: Most features require you to have my 'communication' mod, which will be releasing soon.)*

# Usage

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/cart69420/smartproxy.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. You can start right away by running `npm run start`. The proxy's port will be `25566` and `6969` for the socket.

    *If you want to customize the ports, navigate to `src/index.ts` (I should add an easier way to do this)*
4. After any edit, run `npm run start` again.

## Notes

* If you try connecting to `<proxy ip>:<proxy port>`, you will be in the server which was set in `src/index.ts` or the last server which got changed to by feature `#2`.
* It is **not** a bright idea to use this on localhost if you want an advantage.
* This works just like [3arthh4ck's PingBypass](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/3arthh4ck). The **closer** you are to the server being proxied, the **better** ping you get.
* If you notice in `src/index.ts`, there are **middlewares**! Intercept packets going in and out. You might need some help from ["packet information page"](https://minecraft-data.prismarine.js.org/?v=1.12.2&d=protocol)
